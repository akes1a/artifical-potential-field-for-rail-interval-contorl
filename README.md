# artifical-potential-field-for-rail-interval-contorl
artifical potential field for rail interval contorl. the code is based on C++, runs on windows and  describes the scene three trains running on the same track, keeping a min safe interval to get a good performance between the efficiency and safety.
project contains two parts.matlab code only contains the apf algorithm part, C++ code is the product, containing the GUI part and algorithm part for c++ version.
